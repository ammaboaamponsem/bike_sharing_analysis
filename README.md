# Data Analysis of Divvy Bike Sharing

The objective of this research is to predict the possibility of a bike being taken back to its original station or location based on bike ride details, emphasizing on a unique part of customer behavior rather than simply usage trends.  

Bike-sharing systems are the modern day-to-day key component in urban transportation, providing an alternative to conventional vehicles for a sustainable transport system. And as such, it is important to understand customer behavior within these schemes to enhance user satisfaction and operational efficiency. One vital aspect of this management is the probability of customers returning bikes to their original locations, which could be a significant influence on the efficiency of bike rebalancing endeavors.
